# this folder contains various CAM files and design resources.

- ### the `gerbers` folder is â€¦ where the gerber files can be found.

- the remaining stuff is mostly about panels, ie layout + dimensions:

  - .fpd (for use with front panel express / schaeffer)
  - .svg and .pdf (for use with whatever)
  - .fzz is another panel design. you'll need fritzing to edit it, adjust pot-sizes, graphics, etc
